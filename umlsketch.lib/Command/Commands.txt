Commands are organized in the following way:

1.  There is always one container class that holds the complete bunch of all available commands for a specific context,
	e.g. all commands that operate on the complete classifier list or all commands that operate on a single classifier.
	These classes always end with "Commands"
2.  The commands itself. These are the items contained in the "Commands" classes. Every command class is responsible for a single
	command. They simply end with "Command" in their name.

Steps to add new commands:

1. Create a class for the command, decide whether it operates on a single item or on the complete list.
2. Add a method to the correct "Commands" list so that it can be accessed from outside.
3. If necessary, let the view model implement and forward a call to the "Commands" list.
