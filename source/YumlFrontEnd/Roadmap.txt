Goal is to provide a useable application as fast as possible.

Therefore, the following steps are necessary:

1. Save/Load the classifier dictionary to/from file
	1.1 Automap from Domain -> Dto (for saving) -> Done
	1.2 Automap from Dto -> Domain (for loading) -> Done
	1.3 Map system types to existing types (don't serialize them)
2. Print the classifier in yuml format
	2.1 Print simple classes with name and property list
	2.2 Store color for class
3. Have a UI where the classifiers data are visible
	3.1 Use Caliburn micro -> Done
	3.2 Use simple controls
	3.3 Use either Modern UI or sketch UI -> Done
	3.4 Title bar and maybe window controls should also have sketch style
4. Have a UI where the yuml diagram is rendered
5. Add relations to diagram
6. Add methods to classifiers
7. Add notes
8. Import from assembly, synchronize with existing classes
